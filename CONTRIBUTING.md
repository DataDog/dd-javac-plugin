## Requirements

A JDK needs to be installed in order to run Gradle.
Minimum supported version is JDK 8.  

# Building

To build the project without running tests run:
```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
```

To build the entire project with tests run:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

## Intellij IDEA

In `Project Settings` -> `Modules` ensure that the following modules have JDK 8 set as their module SDK:
- `main`
- `test`
- `dd-javac-plugin-client/main`
- `dd-javac-plugin-client/test`

`java11` module needs JDK 11 set as its module SDK.
